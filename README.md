# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This is a learning project created as part of the education curriculum at Lighthouse Labs.

## Features

- Tired of embarrassing yourself on Twitter? Use Tweeter instead! As a learning project Tweeter has no internet connectivity: it keeps your obnoxious, inflammatory remarks safe on your local computer where employers and family can't see them!
- Try it out on Desktop & Mobile! The responsive design will automatically adjust to fit your screen.
- Want to change the colour scheme and animations? Flex your developer skills and dig in to those CSS files!
